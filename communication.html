          <p>This lab provided a methodological <br> research path
            in product design problem <br> finding, setting and solving
            with analysis, <br> goal setting and concept generation.
            <br>This approach allowed us to acquire the <br> knowledge and
            tools for the metaproject <br> process. The focus of my group
            concerned <br>anonymity as a social, personal and <br>job-related
            matter. We then designed a <br>system called Remikks which
            found its <br>practical depiction in an app of basic<br> features.
            Remikks was a mobile app which <br>allowed people to attend events
             closely <br>related to their tastes in music genre <br>though in
             a complete and anonymous way.</p>

          <p>The Graphics Computer Laboratory interacted <br>
            with Architecture Information, an inter-disciplinary <br>
            field straddling the worlds of design, graphics <br>
            and publishing with a special focus on the  <br>
            third dimension. The applied computer science <br>
            module dealt with web communication, revolving <br>
            around the issues of presentation of Computer <br>
            Graphics contents and design and implementation <br>
            of interactive elements. The Digital Design  <br>
            module tackled the switch from bi-dimensional <br>
            representation to the creation of  <br>
            three-dimensional models. The project of my  <br>
            group was called Jack il Signore dei Fagioli <br>
            (literally Jack the Lord of the Beans)  <br>
            and was an reinterpretation of Jack and the <br>
            Beanstalk through a Lord of the Rings lens. <br>
            We created three-dimensional models and  <br>
            landscapes, coded games and made an  <br>
            interactive webpage.</p>

          <p>The Lab was aimed at producing, at the<br>
            end of the educational program, an oriented <br>
            branding design project. It was oriented to the<br>
            acquisition of basic knowledge about the concepts <br>
            of brand, logotype, coordinated image and whatever<br>
            else is useful for creating graphic design <br>
            artifacts and their derivatives with a view to <br>
            constructing the brand identity. The project of <br>
            my group, Spazio Grafico, consisted in a graphic <br>
            museum characterized by an engaging, colloquial <br>
            and down to earth tone of voice, aimed at showing <br>
            the historic, social and economic background in <br>
            which a certain piece of graphic art was developed<br>
             rather than exposing it on a blank wall without <br>
             any kind of emotional engagement.</p>
