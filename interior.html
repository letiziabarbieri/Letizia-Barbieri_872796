          <p>For this lab critical thinking and concept <br>
            generation were a primary focus, where drawing<br>
             and model making activities were integrated <br>
             to establish this process. The primary concern <br>
             of the course was to foster strategies for <br>
             dealing with product form, function and use <br>
             via observation techniques. Then we had to apply <br>
             these techniques to the solution of a design <br>
             problem and its resolution through a process <br>
             of design.  The theme of that year was the <br>
             revaluation of a disused space in a rough<br>
              district of Milan. The project of my group was <br>
              to turn it into a sheltered place, where <br>
              people of all ages could gather and spend time <br>
              together. Recollection was  a museum of the <br>
              people, where everyone could bring something <br>
              that belonged to them and stood for them. <br>
              It turned out to be more of an experiential <br>
              process, through which people became acquainted <br>
              to other people by getting to know themselves <br>
              first, tearing down social barriers and prejudices. </p>

          <p>The aim of the course was testing technical<br>
            multimedia skills in the contest of communication <br>
            within industrial design. Therefore, I was trained <br>
            to design and realize the presentation of a project <br>
            by applying the acquired know-how about multiple <br>
            media tools. These techical boards would represent <br>
            the revaluation of Apartment Bolchini, a loft <br>
            designed in the early thirties by Luciano Baldessari.</p>

          <p>This lab introduced and developed the role of <br>
            visual languages and of their respective tools <br>
            and techniques aimed at the morphological, <br>
            material and functional representation of the <br>
            project, through the development and interpretation <br>
            of perceptive mechanisms and chromatic systems.<br>
            My group designed the visual communication around <br>
            The Fifth, a speakeasy hypothetically set in New <br>
            York. The installation that is showed in the <br>
